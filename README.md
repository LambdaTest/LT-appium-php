# How to handle permission pop-ups in Real Devices on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-php-permissions) using the Appium & PHP

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where you would like to automatically handle permission pop-ups. You may choose to either accept all permission pop-ups or dismiss all of them. You can handle the case as mentioned below separately for Android or iOS apps. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-php).

# Steps:

The following is an example on how to handle permissions in the capabilities in the automation script.

```
<?php
    require __dir__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
    use Facebook\WebDriver\Remote\DesiredCapabilities;
    use Facebook\WebDriver\Remote\RemoteWebDriver;
    use Facebook\WebDriver\WebDriverBy;

    $caps = array(
        "app"=>"lt://", //Enter app_url here
        "deviceName" => "Galaxy S20",
        "platformName" => "Android",
        "platformVersion" => "10",
        "isRealMobile" => TRUE,
        "visual" => TRUE,
        "video" => TRUE,
        "name" => "Php - Android test",
        "build" => "Php Vanilla - Android",

        //GRANT PERMISSIONS FOR ANDROID
        "autoGrantPermissions" => TRUE,
                
        //ACCEPT ALERTS FOR IOS
        "autoDismissAlerts" => TRUE,

        //DISMISS ALERTS FOR IOS
        "autoAcceptAlerts" => TRUE

    );

    $username = getenv("LT_USERNAME") ? getenv("LT_USERNAME") : "username"; //Enter username here
    $accesskey = getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") ? getenv("LT_ACCESS_KEY") : "accesskey"; //Enter accesskey here

    $driver = RemoteWebDriver::create("https://$username:$accesskey@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",$caps);

 try{
    $color_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('color'));
    $color_element->click();

    $text_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('Text'));
    $text_element->click();

    $toast_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('toast'));
    $toast_element->click();

    $notification_element = $driver->findElement(WebDriverBy::id('notification'));
    $notification_element->click();
    $driver->quit();

 } finally {
    $driver->quit();
 }

?>
```

### Executing The Tests

Execute the following command (iOS or Android) to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
php IOSApp.php
```

```bash
php AndroidApp.php
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
